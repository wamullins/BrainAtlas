# Brain Atlas

## Description

Brain Atlas allows the user to search through the various structures in our brains using a visual interface and see information about each region. The main purpose of this project iss to tie together information from various sources through a navagatable, sketched brain model and allow users to add additonial research that they think is relevant. At each information page about a various region, the user is also given reseach articles that are related to this region of the brain. Any user can submit an article to be added to the database; however, first the article must be approved by an administrator through the admin portal. In the admin control page, an admin can search for articles by brain region or by unapproved status. THe admin can then choose whether or not to approve the article and have it show up or delete it (admin can also delete articles after they have been approved).

## Technologies Used

This website uses Javascript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, and Express

## Website

-   This is where I'll have the deployed URL once I do it ASAP

## Next Steps

-   Deploy on Railway
-   Work to smooth out the region selection on the navigation brains. Overlapping of png files is making it tricky to select the desired area for some regions.
-   Create robust navigation brains that don't lose their proper layout on window resizing
-   Include OAuth for admin and build up functionality for users to sign in as well
-   Restructure code to work with states rather than a ton of smaller functions running around and resetting everything
-   Continue to add relevant research articles and increase the number of brain regions represented.
